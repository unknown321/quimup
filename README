    QUIMUP
    version 1.4.4

    for MPD 0.17.0 and above

    quimup@jhanalog.com

    __________________________________________________________________________

    QUIMUP is a client for the Music Player Daemon (MPD) written in c++ and
    QT5. The program can be used with most Linux desktops (KDE, GNOME, XFCE)
    and is covered by the General Public License (see LICENSE below).

    The clean interface makes controlling MPD's features easy and intuitive.
    The focus is on mouse handling: playlist management is done entirely by
    drag-&-drop; all playback functions are accessible from the system tray.
    Quimup aims to turn MPD into a perfect desktop music player.

    ** USING QUIMUP **

    CHECK OUT : FAQ.txt
    CHECK OUT : TIPS IN THE SETTINGS WINDOW's ABOUT TAB

    If MPD is configured correctly it's all click, drag and drop really.

    EXTERNAL FILES

    Files that are not in the database can be dropped on the player or on the
    playlist. Alternatively use the 'send to' or 'open with' command in your
    file manager or create a custom 'action'(pass %U or %F).

    But ..this will only work if the connection with mpd is established through
    a so called socket. In MPD's configuration file the 'bind_to_address' must
    point to "/home/USER/.mpd/socket" (replace USER with the name of your home
    dir). In Quimup's login profile (in the settings window) 'Host' must be
    set exactly the same.

    It may be necessary to associate relevant file types to 'open with' 
    Quimup (this is usually done in the file's 'properties' tab). Make sure
    to use 'quimup %U' rather than just 'quimup' as command.
