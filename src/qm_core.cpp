	***************************************************************************
	The only purpose of the 'core' is to provide KDE with a main program window
    (albeit invisible) that can be closed on shutdown (or logout).
	
    The player window ignores the close-event to allow close-to-tray behavior.

    But it will also ignore the close-event evoked by KDE on shutdown, which
    consequently aborts the logout procedure.

    This 'core' however accepts the close-event, and it's child, the player
    window, is closed with it.

	The player can close itself by calling qApp->quit().
